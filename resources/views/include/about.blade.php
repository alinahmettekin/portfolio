                I recently graduated with a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering.
                I am particularly focused on the mobile programming field with a specialization in Flutter,
                PHP with Laravel and .NET Framework. I'm currently publishing apps on Google Play Store. Additionally, I
                have taken training courses and completed
                small-scale
                projects involving other frameworks such as Java Spring, Vue.js, backend with C#. My goal is to become a
                professional in the areas of mobile, web and backend development.
